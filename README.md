kitchen-vagrant-metal
=====================

VagrantMetal - a driver for Test Kitchen that wraps around Metal's Vagrant driver.

More later, but: this will be a gem that will use Metal to execute a driver that
Test Kitchen can use.  I.e., install this gem (and Metal and maybe the Metal Vagrant
driver if it ever gets split out and dependencies as needed) and use it as the
vagrant_metal driver.
